JavaSIG
=======

JavaSIG holds the course materials for the Java SIG session. The plan is to upload the materials after each session in order to permit students to peruse the code on their own time. Eventually we will pull from here when we cover the continuous integration topic.

Each topic/session will be in it's own folder with a naming convention of S&lt;topic\#>-&lt;session\#>
